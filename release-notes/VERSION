- Fix a bug with `AsyncXMLInputFactory.createAsyncFor(byte[])`; was not feeding
  initial input.
- Update to Stax2-api 4.0.0 (no major changes but has working generic signatures)

0.9.10 (23-Feb-2015)

#18: Improve location handling, access
 (requested by "wanghaopu@github")
- Refactored async API/implementation, to allow ByteBuffer-backed sources

0.9.9 (19-Aug-2013)

#15: Allow handling of illegal XML characters using `IllegalCharHandler` (configurable)
 (contributed by jakeri@github)
#21: Remove JAXP/SAX auto-registration from META-INF, to avoid conflicts
 (suggested by Dave P)
* Minor improvement to `AsyncUtfScanner.handleNsValuePending()` to avoid problems
  with split (across chunk boundary) namespace declaration.


0.9.8 [08-Apr-2012]

* #4: Added SAXParserFactoryImpl.newInstance(), to reduce likelihood of getting a
    non-Aalto factory.
* #6: Fix ordering problem wrt public/system ids, ReaderConfig construction
* #9: Handle SAX property "document-xml-version" properly
* #12: Fix a bug in async attribute parsing, related to multi-byte UTF-8 char handling

0.9.7 [11-Feb-2011]

* Finally complete non-blocking ("async") parser interface (with
  AsyncXMLInputFactory, AsyncXMLStreamReader) and implementation
  (only missing coalescing mode, and some aspects of entity handling)

0.9.6 [11-Oct-2010]

* Build system converted to use Maven for easier deployment; OSGi bundle,
  moved home page to [http://wiki.fasterxml.com/AaltoHome]

0.9.5 [20-Mar-2009]

* Licensing change to basic Apache License 2.0
* Moved code under "com.fasterxml.aalto" Java package.

0.9.4 [04-Feb-2009]

* Namespace-repairing mode for stream writers implemented.
* Coalescing mode implemented for blocking parsers (can not implement
  for non-blocking, as coalescing requires blocking).
* Partial implementation of Stax2 Validation API for stream writers.

0.9.3 [21-Jan-2009]

* A problem with comments content skipping (when underlying scanner
  is Readers based) fixed: would surface parts of comment content as
  regular text.
* Auto-closing (XMLInputFactory2#P_AUTO_CLOSE_INPUT and
  XMLOutputFactory2#P_AUTO_CLOSE_OUTPUT) wasn't working properly, now is.
* An IndexOutOfBounds problem with character (Writer) backed
  XMLStreamWriter, writeCharacters(char[],int,int) fixed.
* Complete implementation of Stax2 3.0 Typed Access API.

0.9.2 [08-May-2008]

* Fixed stax conformance issue wrt. returning of no prefix/namespace URI;
  now returns "" as expected instead of nulls.
* XMLStreamReader2.getDepth() was off by one for END_ELEMENT events.
* Character escaping was not fully working for attribute values.
* Whitespace was reported in prolog: now gets properly stripped off
  (could implement Stax2 REPORT_WS_IN_PROLOG in future if needed)
* Now disables lazy parsing for event readers, SAX reader, to improve
  accuracy of error reporting (and possible minor performance benefit too)
* Added stax2test unit test suite from Woodstox, for additional
  test coverage via stax2 API.
* Implemented first (incomplete) version of Stax2 3.0 Typed Access API
  (using Stax2 reference implementation's support): readers and writers
  for int, long, boolean.

0.9.1 [13-Mar-2008]

* XMLStreamReader (blocking) implementation:
  * Implemented non-lazy parsing functionality (still defaults to lazy
    parsing so that skipping can be done efficiently).
  * Minor performance improvements to name parsing.
  * Minor performance improvements to namespace URI handling.
* AsyncByteScanner:
  * Location information was not properly updated when input was being
    added, leading to useless location info for error messages.
  * Handling of comments, PIs was incomplete, completed.

0.9.0 [21-Feb-2008]

First public release: contains functional non-DTD-handling reader
implementation (although lacking coalescing mode), non-repairing
stream writer, and a non-robust prototype version of non-blocking
(asynchronous) stream reader.
